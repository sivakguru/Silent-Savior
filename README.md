# Silent-Savior
This project aims to develop a model to identify fire alarms in a building and automatically display a sign language video alert on all TVs, display monitors, and display devices. This system will be particularly beneficial for Hearing Disability and Hard of Hearing individuals, who may not be able to hear the traditional fire alarm sound.
